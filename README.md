## ZeroBalance
iOS application to track, record, and balance payments between friends who split payments on a single invoice. 

## About
Built in Objective-C with CoreData to store transactions and payments between persons. Each transaction shows amounts owed to each person, average payment for a transaction, and a chart to display who paid what.

## Motivation
There are a ton of code samples on the internet and especially from Apple that use Objective-C as the language of choise even though Swift is pushed nowadays. I wanted to dive into Objective-C to get a taste of it so I could understand and translate the various code examples I've seen into Swift code. In addition, learning CoreData was very challenging yet rewarding to figure out the intricacies of CoreData and it's implementation. Lastly, using BuddyBuild to automate deployment while running UI and Unit tests on each build.
